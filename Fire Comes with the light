Hey

I have been thinking about you
Thought i wouldnt know about the trip
Its so absurd 
How do you expect me to move on
This is what time has brought with it

I see you clearly in my thoughts 
From the first day i saw you

Little brown eyes
Never seen a man 
Begged you in the start

"An old man" you laughed.
Until you gave me the chance.
Took you to dates.
Laughed clearly anything that we looked at.

Fell in love.
Oh! dear the arguments.
Late at night debating who peed the floor.
So funny days. 
With that small hand in my palm.
You felt secure. (Oh for the reader i am only 3 years older)

It isnt proper how we met but i always picture it.
Yes. Please, the romantic high school type.
just nerds who became friends and then found solace in each other.

Love is a wonderful thing.
When you have a great queen.
Guess what you were my lioness.
Cooked for me.
I give the credit of my body weight to you.
I tried to leave you didnt give up.

The wind blows your hair and i can smell the radiant.
The crown on your face.
i envy you. All this beauty how were you made.
And then i thank your mother that gave you that smile.
Those lips. The wide-light teeth.
Oh! shoot the nose ring.
Ofcourse i love it baby.

We grew together.
You blessed me for that i thank you.
Those hips sure did what they had to do.

I find you attactive in very many ways.
When you speak. Oh! no.
That gaze.
The long neck.
And not forgetting the chest the treasure in those.
That fed the me that is to live tommorrow.
I find you attractive.
Even when your annoyed.
I love watching you be sad and stress about things.
When you try again and again.
i don't know if I love it.
i love you.

i guess its what i got.
i love your hips.
The curves.
The soft-tender ass.
i love every things from the thighs to the toes.

You are so beautiful.
